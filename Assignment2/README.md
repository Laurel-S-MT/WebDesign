# This Weeks Reflection

This module was a little bit difficult for me-I could be overthinking things or just notunderstanding enough. I feel as though I'm missing key things to coding in the lesson. Like how to edit the size of the images, how to place it in certain spots-whats the code for that? I can not figure it out no matter how many google searches and trials.
Another thing I'm having trouple is how to edit certain images and other elements that use the "div" a lot of the images just seem to be grouped into only one div in the css file, I dont knnow how to keep them separted and edit them on their own. The website so far is only how much I can so for now.
