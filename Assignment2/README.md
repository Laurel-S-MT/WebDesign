# This Weeks Reflection

This module was a little bit difficult for me-I could be overthinking things or just not understanding enough.  It's probably me misreading the instructions.
I am having trouble is how to edit certain images and other elements that use the "div" a lot of the images just seem to be grouped into only one div in the css file, I'm not sure how to keep them separted and edit them on their own. The website so far is only how much I can so for now. Again-I'm probably missing somethings on my own. Not the lesson. I'll be trying to look more closer at the instructions to gain a better understanding.
