# This Weeks Reflection

I hadnt gotten any peer feedback from what I saw in my post, but I definately focused on using different colors instead of the ones provided in the previous lesson and it become my own instead.

I wanted to focus on color because one; colors are fun, and two; they help with the presentation of what is displayed and the aestetic of it depending on what it is. For this case it was about a book, its cover a similar color scheme.
