# Final Reflection
## What are you most proud of in your final project?
Genuinely, having everything work. I’ve said it before, coding is not my strong suit and it’s difficult to keep track of it all and try to find the reason behind any error. I’m also happy how my website looks; it doesn't look too bad. Better than when I first started.

## What would you add or refine in the future?
I would definitely refine the organization of code in the css page. There’s a lot to keep track of. I’d most likely add more notes and description to what bundle of code it belonged to and what html page it was being used in.
