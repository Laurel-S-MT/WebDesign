# This Weeks Reflection
Grid seems fun to try and customize, I'll have to practice more with it to see what else I can do with it. Flexbox looks to be more simpler and easier to align things for me. Its nice.
My workflow will hopfully add ease from its simplicity.
Its hard to say what my preferred layout is I still need to get familiar with it. I do like the look of the flex box layout however.
